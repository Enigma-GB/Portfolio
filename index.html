  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p> With over 20 years of experience in the Further Education sector, I have worked in Legacy Stow, Kelvin and the City of Glasgow Colleges. Currently, I am a Library and Flexible Learning Officer at Kelvin College, collaborating with staff and students to provide and promote our library services and digital collections and working as part of the wider AGLS team. 
    Until May 2023, I also worked as a lecturer in the Trade Union Education Department at the City of Glasgow College. In this capacity, I worked in workplace learning, developing, and delivering adult literacy and IT courses. My responsibilities included providing ongoing guidance, conducting training sessions, creating training and teaching materials, and assessing and evaluating student performance. This dual role has required me to develop strong time management skills, maintain a high level of organisation, and demonstrate significant initiative. Effective communication has been essential for working between both institutions and it was also crucial in each of my roles where I had to meet the needs of many stakeholders including students, staff, unions, workplaces, and funding bodies.
    Personally, I am a reliable, hardworking, and resourceful individual who approaches work with openness, honesty, and integrity. I find the Further Education sector to be a highly rewarding and stimulating environment. I enjoy problem-solving in a collaborative manner and strive to employ best practices whenever possible. With a keen attention to detail, I am always eager to learn, adapt, and embrace new ideas and challenges, especially in the realm of new learning technologies.
